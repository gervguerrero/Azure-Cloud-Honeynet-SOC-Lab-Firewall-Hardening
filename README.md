This page showcases hardening Microsoft Azure Firewalls in an Incident Response process. This builds off my repository [Azure-Cloud-Honeynet-SOC-Lab](https://github.com/gervguerrero/Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab/tree/main), and [Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab-Incident-Response-Investigation](https://github.com/gervguerrero/Azure-Cloud-Honeynet-SOC-Lab-Incident-Response-Investigation/edit/main/README.md)

In Microsoft Azure, I built a public facing Honeynet to attract real world cyber attackers to monitor their TTPs. Here I showcase a basic security response action plan to a successful brute force login incident seen in Microsoft Sentinel. This is where the Containment, Eradication, & Recovery phase of the Incident Response lifecycle based on NIST 800-61 takes place. The goal is to successfully implement 5 layers of firewalls based on NIST's 800-53 R5 SC-7 Boundary Protection guidelines, effectively hardening the Azure network to prevent brute force attempts from happening.

 # Vulnerable Network 
![uncsecure net map](https://github.com/gervguerrero/Azure-Cloud-SOC-Lab-Incident-Response/assets/140366635/97549972-f13c-445c-9719-38f30ecf44ae)

The Azure cloud environment was left wide open without any real protection from cyber threat actors on the internet. The map shows  5 layers of defenses that were left open for threat actors to directly connect to the virtual machines and brute force/login into.

1. Azure Firewall
2. Network Service Group (NSG) covering the entire virtual network
3. Network Service Group specific to each virtual machine
4. Operating System specific firewalls to each virtual machine and firewall rules specific to the Blob Storage/Key Vault
5. Private Endpoint Protection for Blob Storage/Key Vault (Not configured, not shown on map.)

This page will demonstrate configuring each security control and how it can prevent the brute force incident from occuring.

# 1. Azure Firewall 
### Threat Actor Access Before Controls
Starting with the most external security control, introducing and configuring an Azure Firewall properly can prevent unwanted remote deskop protocol (RDP) requests to the Azure network.

Here we can see evidence without this security control, that any external IP can perform RDP into our Windows 10 virtual machine, as well as ping the machine:

### Configuring Controls

When introducing an Azure Firewall to the network, a default route needs to be made to route the internal traffic through the firewall to be filtered and inspected. 

First we create a route table:

Next we have to associate the route table to the virtual subnet our target vm is in. (Windows 10 VM)

In larger environments, weâ€™ll have to attach the route table to any subnet that has clients that needs to access the internet through the firewall. (but donâ€™t apply the routing table to the azure firewall, or azure firewall management subnet. Just the subnet with our target VM)

This is us associating the subnet our target vm (or client workstations) are in:
